***"Uncovering latent VOC emissions and spatiotemporal drivers of urban ozone in changing NOx regimes: A data-driven case study of Los Angeles and Chicago"***
with M. Kelp and L. J. Mickley, funded jointly by the Harvard University Center for the Environment and Harvard College Research Program

The goal of this project was to investigate anomalous spatiotemporal air pollution patterns in urban areas. In the United States, air pollution mitigation legislation and other emissions reduction measures have successfully reduced the concentrations of primary pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in recent years. However, these emissions reductions have not as easily reduced concentrations of ozone (O3) and other secondary pollutants. While both NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contribute directly to ozone production, this production follows a nonlinear relationship that complicates pollution mitigation and requires precise care. This project served to inform potential ozone reduction strategies by taking a data-driven approach, performing spatiotemporal inference through modal unsupervised learning methods that extract meaningful features from pollution data.

Specifically, by leveraging a long-term (2000-2016) daily 1 km2-resolution dataset of ozone, NO2, and PM2.5 concentrations derived from observations, multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD) could then identify areas of high ozone production efficiency across space and time. After investigating several urban areas, it became clear that Los Angeles and Chicago were particularly meaningful to explore due to their characteristic transitions from VOC-limited to NOx-limited regimes. This was confirmed by the declines in NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations being accompanied by sharp increases in ozone concentrations across the duration of the collected data. Since biogenic and fugitive sources of VOCs are challenging to pinpoint, observing the spatiotemporal distribution of ozone in these particular urban areas thus provided insight into VOC emission sources. Using the three pollutant component datasets, mrDMD was leveraged to isolate spatial modes on varying timescales, which served to describe how dominant spatial patterns have evolved in time, particularly separating them as long-term and short-term modes.

In doing this, it was observed that spatial patterns reflected by such modes could be corroborated by plotting the spatial data as a time-evolution video. Historical pollution events on both the short-term timescale, like wildfires, and the long-term timescale, like vehicle emissions policies, could be viewed as individual modes extracted by the mrDMD algorithm as meaningful signals, which provided fruitful information for analysis. Then, by using pollutant concentration ratios as a proxy for ozone production efficiency, we could discover even more insightful information about the underlying drivers of ozone production. For example, it was observed that in areas like the Huntington Beach area of Los Angeles, there exist both long-term and short-term modes that indicate relatively higher levels of ozone production efficiency, which could be indicative of topographical features, the large marshy wetland in the area, or other climate patterns. Altogether, the spatiotemporal information garnered from the modes can then be used to drive future policies targeting ozone reduction in areas of high ozone production efficiency.
